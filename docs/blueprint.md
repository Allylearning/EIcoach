## Original User Request:
Emotional Intelligence Game Plan ‚Äî Interactive AI-Analysed Reflection

Prompt Title:
Code an interactive EI reflection tool with open-ended questions and supportive AI feedback based on user tone and model content

‚∏ª

üéØ Goal:

Build a web-based learning interaction where users answer one EI-focused question at a time. After each response, AI provides supportive, non-judgmental feedback aligned with the tone and language used by the user, referencing best-practice strategies from a provided model answer.

‚∏ª

üíª Key Features to Implement

1. Question Flow & Input UI
	‚Ä¢	Show one question at a time on the screen with a clean, calming UI.
	‚Ä¢	After the user submits their text, lock the input and show AI-generated feedback below.
	‚Ä¢	Include ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to go to the following question.
	‚Ä¢	After all four questions, display a summary reflection.

2. Questions & Model Answers

Hardcode the four questions and their corresponding model answer content (as provided in your original input).

Each question maps to a specific pillar:
	‚Ä¢	Self-Awareness
	‚Ä¢	Self-Regulation
	‚Ä¢	Empathy
	‚Ä¢	Relationship Management

3. AI Integration

Use Gemini API (or OpenAI if easier for prototyping) to:
	‚Ä¢	Analyze the user‚Äôs answer
	‚Ä¢	Compare it to the model answer
	‚Ä¢	Generate supportive feedback using the user‚Äôs tone and phrasing
	‚Ä¢	Highlight strengths, encourage reflection, and gently suggest ideas from the model content

4. Feedback Guidance for the AI

Structure prompt sent to Gemini like this:
{
  "prompt": "You are a friendly, emotionally supportive coach helping someone reflect on their emotional intelligence. Here's their response to a question:\n\nQuestion: ${currentQuestion}\n\nUser's response: ${userInput}\n\nUse this model answer for insight:\n${modelAnswer}\n\nGive them supportive feedback. Use their tone and style where possible. Be non-judgemental, empathetic, and encouraging. Highlight what they're doing well. Offer thoughtful suggestions using simple language."
}
